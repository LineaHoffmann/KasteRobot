REVISED README [soepe - 14/12/2020]

Please run the installation script as a root user:

$ sudo ./install_kasterobot.sh

This will install either development or runtime dependencies
After running that, the following things are missing:
	Setup of MySQL server (there is no remote)
		It has to be fairly default, using mysql_native_password
		Run the kasteRobotSqlScript.sql to setup the basic framework
		Create a user with CRUD privileges for the database
	Starting the ursim virtual machine

To build the project:
$ mkdir build
$ cmake ../src
$ make

It should build successfully, creating a KasteRobot executable

==== FOR SETTING UP THE MYSQL SERVER ====
#########################################
	To set up the server for connections, in terminal:
		sudo mysql_secure_installation
	Don't use password validation
	Set a non-blank root password
	After this, in terminal:
		mysql -u root -p
			mysql> CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
	Replace the following: 
	username with the wanted login username, 
	host with localhost,
	password with actual password
			mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on *.* TO 'username'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
	Replace username with the previously selected username and localhost with previously selected host
			mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password'
	Replace password with the root user password
			mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	Ensure that it's running on the default port
			mysql> SELECT @@port;
	It should be 3306. Quit after this.
			mysql> \q
	Try logging in to the server with the new user:
		mysql -u username -p
	Try opening the MySql Workbench. Remeber to add the key for the root user if not asked.
